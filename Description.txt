This project is a data processing and analytics pipeline for airline data, leveraging the power of PySpark for scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations and machine learning. The pipeline reads large datasets of airport, flight, and plane information, transforms and cleans the data by handling missing values, renaming columns, and calculating new features, such as flight duration and plane age.

Using Spark SQL, the project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), detecting patterns like delay rates and flight durations across different carriers and destinations. Advanced feature engineering adds interaction variables and outlier detection based on distance. To prepare for machine learning, it encodes categorical data and assembles features to build predictive models, such as logistic regression, that can classify delayed flights.

The pipeline includes model evaluation using cross-validation and outputs insights about flight delays and patterns, as well as feature interactions. Finally, it includes code to save the processed data and model outputs to SQL Server, making it ready for integration into business intelligence tools or downstream applications.
